            <p>I've compiled a list of my top tips and tricks from my years in the kitchen. They're organized into four categories, so click on each category to reveal the tips!</p>

            <div id="accordion">

                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <button class="tip-category"><h2>Cooking Basics</h2><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
                    
                    <div class="panel">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before cooking anything in a skillet, remember to add butter or olive oil! This will make sure the food is nice and crispy AND won't stick to the pan.</li>
                            <li>If you're boiling pasta or potatoes, reserve some of the cooking water when you're draining the food. Add some of this starchy water back to the pot to create some delicious thickness.</li>
                            <li>Don't skimp on salt and pepper. You should be adding seasoning to every dish, possibly multiple times. You don't want your food to be bland!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <button class="tip-category"><h2>Baking Basics</h2><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></button>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <ul>
                            <li>When making chocolate chip or sugar cookies, you should refrigerate your dough for at least 30 minutes before baking the cookies. This prevents the cookies from spreading too flat in the oven.</li>
                            <li>You should always use unsalted butter when baking. However, if you only have salted butter, you can reduce the salt amount by 1/4 tsp for every stick of salted butter you use.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <button class="tip-category"><h2>Meal Planning</h2><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <ul>
                            <li>As a rule of thumb, ensure every planned meal has a protein, a starch, and a vegetable. For example, a balanced pasta dish would include noodles, grilled chicken, and some roasted vegetables (and a sauce of course).</li>
                            <li>Only eat leftover meals if they've been refrigerated for 4 or fewer days. If it's been 5 or more days, they should be disposed of.</li>
                            <li>Take advantage of your freezer by storing meal-prepped meals in there! They can be stored up to 3 months in the freezer, and typically need 24 hours to defrost in the fridge. Do not defrost food on the counter.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>


                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <button class="tip-category"><h2>Cleaning Tips</h2><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <ul>
                            <li>When hand washing dishes or appliances, you should always be using hot water. Especially if dishes have oily or sticky residue, the hot water (with dish soap) will easily clean it off.</li>
                            <li>If crumbs pile up on your counters, you can use a mini vacuum to clean them up!</li>
                            <li>If a pan has residue that will not come off, soak it overnight with hot water and dish soap. If that doesn't work, consider scrubbing it with baking soda and water.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
